<h1>Why to do outreach?</h1>
<p>We, humans, invented a laguage to comunicate with the Universe that we called <strong>Science</strong>.
Scientists have the responsability to translate the equations in paper or thousand of code lines in an easy-to-understand language for all the people. In this way, we all can enjoy of this human adventure to understand the Universe.</p>
<h2>My contributions to astronomy outreach</h2>
<h3>Wolfson AstroClub</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wolfson.ox.ac.uk/">Wolfson College</a> is one of the many Colleges at the University of Oxford. 
It stands out not only for academic excellence but also for its beautiful natural surroundings, nestled close to green spaces and water bodies.
Inspired by this unique environment, 
While I was the Dennis-Sciama Junnior Research Fellow at Wolfson College, I founded the <a href="https://www.wolfson.ox.ac.uk/sports-clubs-and-societies/#jump-collapse10030">Wolfson AstroClub</a> with the vision to connect
the college community to the wonders of the night sky.</p>
<p>The idea of an on-campus astronomy club was immediately embraced by the Social and Cultural Committee (SCC),
who provided funding to purchase essential equipment, including two amateur telescopes. Under my leadership as president since 2022, 
the club has flourished, hosting dozens of outreach events each year. These include public talks, guided telescope viewings, and 
sky observation sessions designed to engage participants of all experience levels.</p>
<p>Our telescopes offer a hands-on <em>Galileo-like</em> experience with manual control, 
fostering a deeper appreciation for the skill involved in early astronomy. 
Highlights for visitors often include observing Jupiter’s moons and Saturn’s iconic rings, 
which never fail to inspire awe. Beyond stargazing, the club has created a vibrant community where students share their passion 
for astronomy and learn through direct interaction with the cosmos. This has significantly enriched the social and intellectual 
life at Wolfson College.</p>

<h3>Outreach talks</h3>
<p>I have been honored to give numerous outreach talks across different countries and diverse settings, 
including such well-regarded events as <em>Pint of Science</em> in the UK, <em>Astronomy on TAP</em> in Sweden, 
and <em>Noche de las Estrellas</em> in Mexico, among many others.</p>
<p>My philosophy for these talks is deeply romantic: I view outreach as a journey through the rich historical tapestry of 
human knowledge—explaining not just the facts, but the profound paradigm shifts that have transformed our understanding 
of the cosmos and reshaped the human <em>cosmovision</em>, including its social effects on everyday life such as art.
I emphasize how each great shift in scientific thinking echoes the changes in how humanity sees itself in the Universe.</p>
<p>I always focus on making each presentation inspiring and heartfelt, convincing my audience that curiosity is an intrinsic part of human nature. 
By exploring the stars, we embark on a voyage of self-discovery, 
learning not only about the Universe but also about what it means to be human.</p>

<h3>Media</h3>
<h4>Astronomía Divertida</h4>
<p>I was privileged to be an active collaborator in the outreach group <a href="https://astronomiadivertida.wordpress.com/">Astronomía Divertida</a>, 
an initiative dedicated to making astronomy accessible and enjoyable for Spanish-speaking audiences worldwide. 
Our mission was to break down complex astronomical concepts into engaging, easy-to-understand formats that spark curiosity and wonder.</p>
<p>In this project, I took on multiple roles: writing scripts for our educational videos, appearing as a presenter to explain scientific 
topics clearly and enthusiastically, and contributing original articles to our 
<a href="https://astronomiadivertida.wordpress.com/author/oscaribv/">blog</a>, where I mostly focused on breaking news about exoplanet discoveries 
and sharing personal insights that revealed the humanity behind astronomical research. Additionally, 
I helped manage our social media channels, fostering community interaction and ensuring our content reached a broad and diverse audience.</p>
<p>One of our standout videos explains the <em>transit method</em>, a cutting-edge technique used to find planets around other stars. 
Through simple visuals and clear narration, we empowered viewers to understand how tiny dips in a star’s brightness reveal distant worlds, 
thereby deepening public engagement with current astronomical research.</p>

<h4>Television and Radio interviews</h4>
<p>I have been featured in various media outlets, discussing major astronomical events and sharing scientific knowledge
with the general public. A notable example is my involvement in the outreach efforts surrounding the <em>Mazatlán Eclipse</em> in 2024. 
This event drew widespread media attention, and I contributed by helping organize public viewing events and providing expert commentary.
This media exposure included interviews and features on the 
<a href="https://dcs.uas.edu.mx/noticias/8852/la-comunidad-sinaloense-se-reune-en-la-facultad-de-ciencias-del-mar-de-la-nueva-universidad-en-mazatlan-para-disfrutar-del-eclipse-solar-2024">Universidad Autónoma de Sinaloa newsletter</a> 
and <a href="https://amexi.com.mx/nacional/universidad-autonoma-de-sinaloa-suspende-clases-por-eclipse-solar/">AMEXI news</a>.
These appearances helped raise public awareness about the scientific importance of the event and encouraged safe and informed observation practices.</p>

<h3>Astronomy in Rural Mexico</h3>
<p>I played an active role in bringing astronomy outreach to remote and underserved communities in rural Mexico, 
organizing observation sessions, public talks, and hands-on activities to inspire curiosity and scientific engagement. 
These efforts aimed to bridge the gap in access to science education and to share the wonder of the night sky
with audiences who rarely have such opportunities.</p>
<p>The impact and experiences from this work were later documented and published in the
<em>Communicating Astronomy with the Public Journal</em> (<a href="https://capjournal.org/articles/137/reaching-the-remote-astronomy-outreach-in-rural-mexico">here</a>) 
by colleagues involved in the broader initiative. While I am not a formal coauthor of the article, 
my contributions were part of the collective effort it describes, reflecting a shared commitment to inclusive and meaningful 
science communication.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Magazines</h3>
<p>I have contributed to several outreach publications that target different audiences. Fo
r example, my articles featured in <a href="https://www.popularastronomi.se/tidningen/nummer-3-september-2020/">Popular Astronomy (Sweden)</a> 
present astronomical phenomena with clarity and enthusiasm to a general audience.</p>
<p>As part of my physics training in 2012, I completed social service by writing two outreach texts—one on planets and 
another on black holes—and by helping edit the outreach magazine <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266911395_Revista_de_divulgacion_ConCiencia_2da_edicion">ConCiencia</a>. This experience sharpened my skills in science communication and editorial work, building my ability to engage readers with compelling content grounded in scientific rigor.</p>
